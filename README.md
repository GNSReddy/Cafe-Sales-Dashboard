Cafe Sales Dashboard
A data analytics project analyzing coffee shop sales, revenue, and profit trends from 2021 to 2023.

Files
Coffee Shop Sales Data.. (1).xlsx: Excel dataset containing transactional data (e.g., sales, revenue, profit margins) for coffee shop products like coffee beverages, cold drinks, desserts, and more.
dashboard.xlsm: Macro-enabled Excel file with an interactive dashboard, pivot tables, and visualizations for tracking sales performance by product, location, and time.
Usage
To explore the dashboard:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/GNSReddy/Cafe-Sales-Dashboard.git
Open dashboard.xlsm in Microsoft Excel (ensure macros are enabled) to interact with pivot charts, slicers, and visualizations.
Review Coffee Shop Sales Data.. (1).xlsx for raw data and perform additional analysis as needed.
Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data from a coffee shop chain, focusing on product categories (e.g., Coffee Beverages, Desserts), locations (e.g., Chicago, Los Angeles), and time periods (2021–2023). Key metrics include Quantity Sold, Revenue, Profit Margin, and Unit Price. The dashboard provides interactive tools to identify top-selling products, peak sales periods, and profitability, enabling data-driven decisions for inventory management, marketing, and expansion.

Key Insights
Coffee Beverages and Desserts are typically the highest revenue generators.
Peak sales often occur on Fridays and in winter months (e.g., January, December).
Cities like Chicago show the highest sales volume, while smaller locations may need targeted strategies.
Tools Used
Microsoft Excel (Macro-Enabled): For data manipulation, pivot tables, conditional formatting, and dynamic visualizations in dashboard.xlsm.
Pivot Charts and Slicers: To create interactive dashboards for real-time tracking.
Notes and Customization:
Repository URL: The clone command uses your repository URL (https://github.com/GNSReddy/Cafe-Sales-Dashboard.git). Ensure this matches exactly; if it doesn’t, update it in the README.
File Names: I’ve kept the exact file names you mentioned (Coffee Shop Sales Data.. (1).xlsx and dashboard.xlsm). If the dataset name has special characters or spaces that cause issues, you might want to rename it for clarity (e.g., Coffee_Shop_Sales_Data.xlsx).
Macros Note: Since you’re using .xlsm, I included a reminder to enable macros in Excel. If macros aren’t used, you can remove this detail.
Project Context: I assumed the data structure is similar to your original "dashboard.xlsx" (sales, revenue, etc.), but now focused on a coffee shop. If the data or metrics differ, let me know, and I can adjust the overview.
